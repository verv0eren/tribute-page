        <p class="text-justify indent">Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, a very interesting character and a great teacher. He worked on quantum physics, quantum electrodynamics, particle physics and superfluidity of liquid Helium. For his work on the development
          of quantum electrodynamics, he, along with other two scientists, recieved the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. During World War II, he assisted in the development of the atomic bomb. He was also a member of Rogers Commission, the panel which
          investigated the space shuttle Challenger Disaster of 1986.</p>
